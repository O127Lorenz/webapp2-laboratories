Case Study #1

Evaluation and Suggestion:

-Since this project started in January 2024 and expected to end in June 1, I will assume that the team that will work for this collaboration should do a proper tasking depends on what is need to be accomplished.Since they almost have 6 months to accomplished  this project which includes debugging and testing, they should use tools that can help them in tracking their progress, one of the tools that I can recommend is Bar Chart, this can be use to assign deadlines in many parts of project, and by the use of this tool, you can assess if the employee can comply and passed their task before deadlines. 

Proper management and a healthy workplace are big factors in a group project. Since this is a "cutting-edge software solution," this means that this project is expected to be advanced in terms of development. The people that will work on it should have good teamwork and should work professionally and ethically in order to achieve their goal for their project. 
, and if it comes to time that someone is struggling, as a team they should try to help and assist each other so that their project parts can run smoothly and properly and comply before the deadline.
